= ESTEI BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir estei-bsp
$: cd estei-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/texierp/yocto-bsp-manifest -b master
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build (QEMU base image):

[source,console]
$: source poky/oe-init-build-env estei-build 
$: export TEMPLATECONF=meta-estei/conf 
$: MACHINE=qemux86-64 bitbake estei-qt-image
$: runqemu qemux86-64 qt-image
